In this small app I tried to build completely minimalistic UI with no distractions and no time-wasting features.

## Available Default React Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Starts the development server on http://localhost:3000

### `npm test`

Runs tests

### `npm run build`

Build the app for production
